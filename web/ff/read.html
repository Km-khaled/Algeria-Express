            The development of the tram network in Algeria requires 
            perfect mastery of the skills acquired during the transfer of know-how
            from the experts of the RATP group to the employees of Rail way.
            These skills are necessary to guarantee the success of these projects at 
            each stage, in particular, the design, commissioning and development of urban 
            rail transport.
            In order to be part of continuous progress, a training center has been
             dedicated since May 2014, bringing together several training sessions focusing 
             mainly on rail safety and support professions.

            availability and reliability of the transport system in order to provide passengers
            with a public service in compliance with AFNOR standards, safety requirements, 
            regularity and of quality. Thus the main missions are:
            Carry out maintenance operations (preventive and corrective) of systems (tracks,
            ticketing, contact wire, power supply, radio, telephony, passenger information, etc.)
            and structures dedicated to the tram, as well as the good state of cleanliness .
            Manage the actions and purchases of spare parts thanks to the CMMS (Computerized
            Maintenance Management). Develop the technical reference system and the related
